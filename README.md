# Canteen-Management-System

We hereby present Canteen Management System, which enables university students of the NSBM Green university to make transactions inside the cafeteria using a system combines JAVA programming along with NetBeans. .My contribute of this project is to create delete function.
Here the system allows admin to remove unwanted records from a database. A “hard delete” permanently removes records from the database, while a “soft delete” simply update the status of a row to indicate that it has been deleted while leaving the data present and intact.
