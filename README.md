# Canteen-Management-System

my contribute of this project is to create delete function.
Here the system allows admin to remove unwanted records from a database. A “hard delete” permanently removes records from the database, while a “soft delete” simply update the status of a row to indicate that it has been deleted while leaving the data present and intact.
